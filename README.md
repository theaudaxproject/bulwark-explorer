=====

Simple cryptocurrency block explorer system.

## Required
This repo assumes `git`, `mongodb`, `node`, `yarn`, and are installed with configuration done.  Please adjust commands to your local environment. 

Download links:

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/

https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

It is also required to have the Audax daemon running in the background. It is recommended to set this up before beginning to set up the explorer so that it syncs by the time you need it.

Our geniuses here at BulwarkCorpâ„¢ have put together a script to do this for you. Just run

`bash script/audaxd_setup.sh`

This will install the latest Audax wallet and create a rpc username/password before starting the daemon.

## Install
`git clone https://github.com/theaudaxproject/bulwark-explorer.git` - copy repo to local folder.

`cd blockex` - change into project directory.

`yarn install` - install packages used by the system.

## Configure
#### BlockEx API Configuration
`cp config.template.js config.js` - setup configuration using template.

#### Database Configuration
`mongo` - connect using mongo client.

`use blockex` - switch to database.

`db.createUser( { user: "blockexuser", pwd: "Explorer!1", roles: [ "readWrite" ] } )` - create a user with the values stored in the `config.js` file from above, meaning they should match.

`exit` - exit the mongo client.

__IMPORTANT:__ _You should not build the frontend using the same `config.js` file as created above or  you WILL LEAK sensitive database information._

#### BlockEx UI Configuration
On the local development machine, not the server/VPS, run `cp config.template.js config.js` to create new configuration file that will have the UI information in it.  

__IMPORTANT:__ _You should have two `config.js` files, one for the server with the sensitive database connection information, and one that is used by the developer/designer on their local machine to configure and build the UI._

#### Crontab
The following automated tasks are currently needed for BlockEx to update but before running the tasks please update the cron script `/path/to/blockex/script/cron_block.sh` for the block with the local `/path/to/node`.

`yarn run cron:coin` - will fetch coin related information like price and supply from coinmarketcap.com.

`yarn run cron:masternode` - updates the masternodes list in the database with the most recent information clearing old information before.

`yarn run cron:peer` - gather the list of peers and fetch geographical IP information.

`yarn run cron:block` - will sync blocks and transactions by storing them in the database.

`yarn run cron:rich` - generate the rich list.

__Note:__ is is recommended to run all the crons before editing the crontab to have the information right away.  Follow the order above, start with `cron:coin` and end with `cron:rich`.

To setup the crontab please see run `crontab -e` to edit the crontab and paste the following lines (edit with your local information):
```
*/1 * * * * cd /path/to/blockex && ./script/cron_block.sh >> ./tmp/block.log 2>&1
*/1 * * * * cd /path/to/blockex && /path/to/node ./cron/masternode.js >> ./tmp/masternode.log 2>&1
*/1 * * * * cd /path/to/blockex && /path/to/node ./cron/peer.js >> ./tmp/peer.log 2>&1
*/1 * * * * cd /path/to/blockex && /path/to/node ./cron/rich.js >> ./tmp/rich.log 2>&1
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/blockex && /path/to/node ./cron/coin.js >> ./tmp/coin.log 2>&1
```

## Build
At this time only the client web interface needs to be built using webpack and this can be done by running `yarn run build:web`.  This will bundle the application and put it in the `/public` folder for delivery.

## Run
`yarn run start:api` - will start the api.

`yarn run start:web` - will start the web, open browser [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

## Test
`yarn run test:client` - will run the client side tests.

`yarn run test:server` - will test the rpc connection, database connection, and api endpoints.

## Development - Important File Locations

#### Client - Frontend (react, react-redux)

`client/App.jsx` - Contains all react routes to components (using react-router-dom)

`client/core/Reducers.jsx` - Contains all reducers used in redux `connect()` mapping (using react-redux)

`client/core/Actions.jsx` - Contains all actions used in redux `connect()` mapping (using react-redux)


#### Server - Rest API (node, express, mongo, mongoose)

`server/route/api.js` - Contains all public rest api endpoint routes

## To-Do
- Write more tests
- Cluster support for api
